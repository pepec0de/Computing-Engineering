/*
Modified run-length encoding.
    Modify the result of problem P10 in such a way that if an element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list. Only elements with duplicates are transferred as [N,E] terms.

    Example:
    ?- encode2([a,a,a,a,b,c,c,a,a,d,e,e,e,e],X).
    X = [[4,a],b,[2,c],[2,a],d,[4,e]]
