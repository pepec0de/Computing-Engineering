/*
Run-length encoding of a list.
    Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method. Consecutive duplicates of elements are encoded as terms [N,E] where N is the number of duplicates of the element E.

    Example:
    ?- encode([a,a,a,a,b,c,c,a,a,d,e,e,e,e],X).
    X = [[4,a],[1,b],[2,c],[2,a],[1,d],[4,e]]
