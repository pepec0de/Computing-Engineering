Generate the combinations of K distinct objects chosen from the N elements of a list
    In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of 12 people? We all know that there are C(12,3) = 220 possibilities (C(N,K) denotes the well-known binomial coefficients). For pure mathematicians, this result may be great. But we want to really generate all the possibilities (via backtracking).

    Example:
    ?- combination(3,[a,b,c,d,e,f],L).
    L = [a,b,c] ;
    L = [a,b,d] ;
    L = [a,b,e] ;
    ... 
*/

combination(0, L, []).
